      <h2>Employment History</h2>
      <p><span>2012- 2013: Paralegal ACMA Ltd</span> When I graduated from the legal practice course, I immediately entered employment with a newly established pension administration company. The business of this company is to administer pension transfers and report to members on the progress of their investments. The director of this company is a qualified solicitor, and my role within the company was dual: on the one hand I researched tax issues relating to pension arrangements, on the other I was employed as a personal assistant to the director for the purpose of carrying on his varied legal work. In this latter capacity I have worked as a paralegal in matters including debt, probate, commercial conveyancing, drafting particulars of claim for litigation, negotiation, drafting contracts, drafting wills, briefing counsel and one instance of corporate fraud involving a dispute valued at £1,500,000 in which my research led to the establishment of a previously unconsidered legal nexus which is currently being pursued. I enjoyed this role because the work was varied and stimulating. Sadly, because the company is experiencing teething trouble, my salary, as a full time legal researcher, could no longer be justified and I am forced to seek new employment. The director continues to use my services on a consultancy basis.</p>
      <p><span>2013 Onwards: Trustee at Cynon Valley Citizens’ Advice Bureau</span> (Voluntary)
I have strong links with Cynon Valley CAB, having started volunteering there while caring for my grandmother. I am now an active member of the trustee board and have helped to oversee the incorporation of the bureau, acted as an advocate on behalf of the organisation at a Central CAB appeal hearing, and handled employment issues within the organisation.</p>
      <p><span>2009-2013: General adviser and social policy coordinator at Cynon Valley Citizens’ Advice Bureau<span> (Voluntary)</p>
      <p><span>2007-2010:</span> I cared full time for my father and grandmother for three years during their terminal illnesses.</p>

      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>Because my position at the pension administration company became financially unsupportable, I am looking for paralegal work. I am quick to learn and eager to adapt myself to any role. In addition to my contractual paralegal work I was frequently required over the last year to man the telephone and conduct face to face dealings with clients. The general quality of my work was complimented as excellent, and I am confident of good references. I am more than happy to work for a trial period on a voluntary basis in order to ascertain whether I will fit in and be useful.</p>
      <p>Wedi astudio’r iaith cymraeg ers 7 mlynnedd, mae’r lefel fy rhuglder yn uwch a dwi’n galluog o gymuno gyda hyder. Dwi’n wastad awyddus i’w defnyddio yn unrhyw sefyllfa naill ai yn y gwaith neu yn ystod sefyllfaoedd cymdeithasol.</p>
